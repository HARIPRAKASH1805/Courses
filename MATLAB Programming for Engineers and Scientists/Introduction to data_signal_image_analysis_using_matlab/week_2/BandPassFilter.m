Band pass filter

Write a function BandPassFilter, which takes as input a [1 x N] vector x (our signal), a scalar Fs (the sampl
high cut-off frequencies for the passband of the filter), and an integer W (the window size of the filter). The fu
using the 'conv' function to create the output filtered signal y. Use the 'same' argument with the 'conv' functio
The steps are:
Create the filter using 'fir1'
Apply the filter using 'conv'
Note: The larger the window size W, the better the filter performance. For audio frequencies with high sampl
performance. We will see how to visualize filter characteristics to verify filter performance in a following lesso

% Apply the filter using 'conv'

Serialization : object to bytestream - writeObject()
Deserialization : byte stream to obj - readObject()


* Serializable, clonable, remote - marker interfaces
* get certain capability
* String and all wrapper class implements Serializable - by default

* If parent class is serializable then all its sub classes are too!

inheritance : is - a (eg : student is a people)
			  has - a (eg : student has an address)
			  
note : Static member's can't be serialized, as they belong to class


note : incase of array / collection - all objects of array/collection must be serializable too else serialization will fail


Externalizable : 

	* facility of writing state of an object into a byte stream in compressed format - not a marker interface
	* writeExternal(ObjectOutput out)
	* readExternal(ObjectInput in)
	
	
	
Transient keyword : 
	* don't want to serialize any member
	* don't store password in a file
	* ignores actual value - stores default value(int = 0, float = 0.0)
	
SerialVersionUID : 
	* serialization at runtime associates with an id
	* verify sender and receiver - of serialized object
	* sender and receiver must be the same
	* don't match - InvalidClassException
	* eg :  private static final long serialVersionUID=1L;

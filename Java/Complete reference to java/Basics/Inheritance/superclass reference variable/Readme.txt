Superclass reference variable

SuperClass var = new SubClass();


can only access the methods and variables that are extended from the superclass

since it has only knowledge of superclass methods and variables

the methods and variables additionally implemented can't be accessed using a superclass reference variable

Since it has no knowledge of its presence



Same holds for interface reference variables

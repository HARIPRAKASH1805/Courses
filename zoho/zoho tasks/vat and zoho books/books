1. bill of supply : 
	* doc - issued by reg person supplying gst exempted pro/services
	
	who 
		1. composition scheme dealers(<1.5 crore turnover) - composition scheme (can't collect tax from customers) - issue bill of supply(lieu of tax invoice) - need to pay govt quarterly(5lakhs / turn over - 5% which is higher)

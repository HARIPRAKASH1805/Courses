book keeping : record transactions in journal - post in ledger
			   accounts - sales, rent exp, wages exp, loan payable
			   
trial balance ( no error - proceed to accounting) - adjust entries

1. add revenue - not recorded
2. add exp - not recorded
3. prepayment - no longer paid
4. depreciation - compute and record


each year - temp accounts ( make zero - transfer to quity capital)


modern software  :

	1. fast and accurate - unable to detect - omitted, entered twice, incorrect accounts used - internal controls must
	
	
accrual - complete reporting, realistoc - earned/incurred


a dependable accounting software - enforce debit = credit


softwares can't avoid : 

	1. incorrect value
	2. entered twice
	3. incorrect account
	


general ledger accounts  :

	sort and store transactions - asset, liability, equity, op rev, op exp, non op rev and gain, non op exp and losses
	
first 3 - balance sheet accounts
last 4 - income statement accounts

asset : cash, short-term investments, accounts receivable, allowance for doubtful accounts, accured revenues, prepaid exp, inventory, supplies, long term investments, land, buildings, equipment, vehicles, furnitues, accumulated depreciation



cash : currency, coins, account balance, petty cash funds, checks - not deposited

short term investments : certificate of deposit, bonds, notes < 1year - sold on stock exchange

accounts receivable  :	customer owe

allowance for doubtful accounts : contra asset account
combined with account receivable = net receivable

accrued revenues : delivered - sales invoice yet to generate

prepaid : insurance, expires every month





Liability - short term loans, current portion of a long term debt, accounts payable, accured expenses(invoice yet to gen), unearned revenue, installment loans payable, mortage loans payable, stockholder's equity accounts, paid in capital (amount for stock)

common stock - par value account(stated value), paid in capital account

	2. operating expense - cost of good, service, salary exp, fringe benefit exp, rent exp, utility exp, utility exp for a particular store, depreciation exp - buildings, equipment, repairs exp
	3. other revenue and gain - sell asset(credit)
	4. other exp and losses - (interest exp, loss, law suit)
	


organize by department, sales reign, warehouse


bank reconcilation : 


1. balance in statement = 300k
   cheque deposited not cleared = 20k
   cheques issued but not present(not yet party deposited cheque - not cleared = 50k (less as bank holds that money)
   
   -----------------------------------------------------------
                     270 k 
   -----------------------------------------------------------
   
2. ledger = 2,60,900
   credited but not recorded = 9800
   interest received = 20
   other charges not recorded in book = 720 (less)
   
 -------------------------------------------------------
				270k
 -------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 common reason for differenceb bank balance and ledger  :
 	1. outstanding cheque
 	2. not presented cheque but issued
 	3. service charge and fee
 	4. printing charge
 	5. error in ledger
 	




Adjust entries  :
    1. bill received late - but dec bill arrived jan 10
    2. prepaid - insurance only that month alone appears - exp
    3. depreciation
   
note : always affects two or more accounts

types of adjusting entries : 

	1. accrued revenue - earned invoice not yet(debit - accrued receivables, credit - service revenues)
	2. accrued expense - incurred but no invoice (temp help exp - debit and accured liability - credit)
	3. deferred revenue - advance(service revenue- debit, deffered revenue - credit)
	4. deferred expense - paid in future(debit - insurance expense, credit - prepaid exp)
	5. depriciation
	
	
Reverse entries  :

	* accrual type - late(but update previous accounting period)
	* not twice - can't be processed(adjusting entry, routinely processed entry) - remove accrual type adjusting entry
	* dated - 1 st day of next accounting period
	
dec 31 - 6000 repairs

repair expenses  (debit) - 6000
accured liability (credit) - 6000

jan 2  :

accured liability (debit) - 6000
repairs expense (credit) - 6k

-----------------------------------------
now adjusted : correctly
-----------------------------------------

note : cash account also get involved



* revesing entry removes liability on dec 31
* puts credit balance in repairs expense - jan 2
* after processing invoice we can credit cash and debit repairs expense




four main fin statements : 
	1. balance sheet
	2. income sheet
	3. cash flow statement
	4. stockholder's equity
	
balance sheet : 
	* asset, liability, equity
	* statement of financial position
	* capital = asset - liability
	
classified balance sheet : 
	* asset - current asset, long term investment, property, plant, equipment, intangible assets(software, license,copyrights, trademark), other assets
	* liability - current, non current
	* stockholder's equity
	

* current asset - cash, short term investments, receivable, inventory, prepaid expense
* investments - long term - real estate, cash reserved for construction, bonds
* current liabilities - with in one year - use of current asset - loan, income tax, accounts payable, current portion of long term debt
* non current liabilities - no due with in a year - mortage, bonds
* stockholder's equity - paid in capital, retained earnings, treasury




Income statements : 

	1. state of operations

multistep income statement  :
	1. gross profit = sales - cost of sales
	2. operating income = gross profit - sell, general, admin exp
	3. net income = operating income - other(interest exp)
	
single step income statement : 
	1. all income - all exp
	2. revenue = sales + investment revenue
	3. total exp = cost of sales + admin.., interest exp
	4. net income = total income - total exp
	

both balance sheet and income statement are linked


+ ve net income increases stock holder's equity
income statement - temporary accounts



Cash flow statement : 

	1. income statement - earned but not received(30days), exp 
	2. cash is king - cash statement must for same period
	
inflow = +ve
outflow = -ve

net total of +ve and -ve amounts = currect cash of company

main sections : 
	1. operating activities
	2. investing
	3. financing
additionally
	1. interest paid
	2. income tax paid
	3. exchange assets other than cash
	
note : net income involves all exp removed from all income

so cash flow depreciation - we are adding
receivable - subtracting as already added
	

operating activities - direct, indirect

indirect : mostly used
	1. depriciation - decreases net income - not involves cash
	2. debit to depreiciation expense
	3. credit to accumulated dep
	4. amount of depriciation - added back to net income
	
net income = 19kk
add back : depriciation exp = 9k

cash flow from operating activities = 28k


receivable increased by 300 means : 

28k - 300 = 27700

(receivables, service revenue tackles) that's why only taking increased amount alone

payable increased by 250

(payable, service expense got tackled) that's why taking increased amount alone

27700 + 250 = 27950

note : receive - debit, pay - credit
note : net income = net income(cash + receivables + ...) - net expense

so cash flow = cash currently have(minus receivales + payables)


1. depriciation : not actually money got reduced but in net income we reduce it
cash remains same so we add depreciation

2. receivable : added as receivable but cash not received
so subtracted from net income

3. payable - reduced from net income but not yet paid cash remains same - so add net income




investing : 

	1. sell - +ve flow
	2. purchase - (-ve) flow

financing activities : 

	1. positive - (received from)
	 	* issue bond, borrow, issue shares, loans
	 2. negative flow
	 	* pay debt, purchase shares, dividend pay
	 	
	 	
Stock holder's equity statement : 

	1. closing cut-off -> accrual method
	2. jan 10 paid(dec 31 - dec expense report liability) then do reverse entry then after paying do credit
	3. changes to stock holder's equity

software : 
	1. seperate handling cash from receivables
	2. reconcile from receipt of record - in ledger
	3. owner approve review purchase order, checks, credit memo

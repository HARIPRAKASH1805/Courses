* after seven year need to be replaced (say) value = 0
* building, machinery, equipment, vehicle, computer, furniture, land improvements


calculate depreciation  :
	1. asset value
	2. estimated - end of life value
	3. life of use
	
(asset cost - estimates end of life value) / year of useful


record depreciaton : 
	1. depreciation expense - adjusting entry - debit
	2. accumulated depreciation - credit
	
depriciation expense - inc stat account
accumulated depriciation : bal sheet acc(contra asset acc)


Methods of calculating depreciation : 
	1. straight line method(same amount of depreciation)
	2. units of activiity/ population(more exp in the year - used more)
	3. double declining balance(initial - large depreciation years in useful period)
	4. sum of the years digits method(initial - large depreciation years in useful period)
	
	
	
straight line depriciation : 	
	1. same amount depreciated every year until end
	
change in salvage value / useful life : 
	say 4 year depreciated 2000 per year
	at the end - found only used 2 more years
	cost = 14k, 8k depreciated - book value = 6k
	2yrs = 6k / 2 = 3k
	year 5 = 3k, year 6 = 3k
	book value = 0
	
	
	
Units of activity : 
	1. 20k - 5000 valuable items - no salvage value
	20k / 5k = 4 (depreciation per item)
	
say 10500, 500 salvage value, useful life = 5000 images

july 1 to dec 31 2020 : 
	* 400 images - 800 depreciation
2021 : 900 images 
	* total depreciation = 800 + 1800 = 2600
	

Double declining balance : 
	* accelerated method - early years more depreciation
	* 200 % declining balance method - two times straight line rate
	* say straight line 10%, double declining will be 200%
	
eg : 100k, 10yrs - double declined method = 2 * 1/10 %
	20%
	
	1 year = 20k (20 % of 100k)
	2 year = 16k (20 % of 80k)
	3 year = 12.8k (20 % of 64k)
	
often use 0 salvage value


sum of years digits depreciation : 
	say 10 yrs
		1 + 2 + ... + 10 = 55
		
	year 1 : 10 / 55 - asset's total depreciation cost
	year 2 : 9  / 55
	
asset total depreciation cost = 100k - 10k = 90k
where 10k is the salvage value
	
	


Selling a depreciable asset : 
	book value - gain / loss
	
profit : book value = 8k, sold = 10k 
loss : 100k --> depreciated 92k -> sold = 6k
2k loss

cash 6k
accumulated depreciation - 92k
loss on sale of truck - 2k


retailer, distributor, service provider --> doesn't manufacture goods - so depreciation recorded as depreciation expense on income statement

depreciation on manufacturing -> depreciation part of inventory (cost of goods)


repairs and maintenance vs capital expenditure : 
	repairs and maintenance expense - broken
	updating asset's capabilities - not an expense - should also be depreciated
	

depreciation is an allocation not valuation : 
	* allocate asset's cost to expense
	* not reports market value

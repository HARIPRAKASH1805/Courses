* inventory : key asset (raw, work in progress, finished)
* sold - remove item cost from inventory
* selling price > inventory price ( profit)

FIFO - remove olders inventory cost, report as sold
LIFO - remove recent cost
weighted average - calc average per unit cost - apply it to both units in inventory and units sold


Inventory systems : 

	1. periodic system : update inventory acc periodically - last day of acc year - upto that record in temporary ledger acc - purchases (end year - process)
	2. perpetual - update regularly 
	
note : sometimes destroy items (fire / stolen) - reported

* inventory is reported at cost


periodic : 
	1. end of year - update, adjust, temp purchase ledger, purchase acc closed and inventory acc adjusted, no cost of goods sold (account) when merchandise occurs
	2. no way to tell cost of inventory and cost of goods sold
	
perpetual method : 
	1. update continuously, reduced by cost of merchandise, no purchase acc (temp), general ledger - cost of merchandise sold
	2. sale of goods - journal entry - record sale / cash or acc receivable
	
	
identical items at increasing cost : 

	1. how remove physically
	2. how costs are removed
	
same book - 1 @ 87, 1 @ 85, 2 @ 89, 1 @ 90 = 440

1. fifo, lifo, average


periodic lifo : 
	1. temp general ledger purchase account
	2. oldest first - so 85 first (price : 100) 
	3. profit = 25
	
periodic lifo : 
	1. 440 - 90 = 20 profit
	2. last in first out
	
periodic average : 
	1. weighted average = 88 (85 + 87 + 89 + 90 + 88) / 5
	2. profit = 22
	

perpetual
	1. constant changing of inventory account - no temp general ledger purchase accounts
	
	
expense to the cost of goods sold : 
	gold dealer - identification number - each has unique price - sell id having bar at that price
	

LIFO : less profit - less income tax paid but has tracking cost


periodic methods : estimate inventory 
loss (report and claim insurance after independent checking)



Estimating inventory  :
	1. Gross profit method
	2. Retail method
	
gross profit method : 
	say 20k
	
income statement : beg inventory : 25k
				   purchase net - 46k
				   ending inventory : 80%
				   
				   gross profit : 20%
				   
step 1: 
	1. cost of goods available : beg inventory + net purchase = 25k + 46k = 71k
	2. gross profit =11 % of 75k = 11200
	3. cost of goods sold = sales - gross profit = 56000 - 11200 = 44800 (or 11% of sales = 11% of 56k = 44800)
	
	ending inventory = cost of goods available - cost of goods sold
					 = 71k(25k + 46k) - 44800(80% of sold 56k)
					 = 26200
					 
					 
Retail method : 

	sepeate column
	
						cost          retail
						
beg inv					11k				15k
purchase net			69k		        85k
goods avail				80k				100k

				JOE - Direct delivery inc(incorporated)
				
*legally established


Accounting software : 

	1. e - recording, invoice
	2. store and retrieve
	3. statements, reports
	
transactions : 

	1. joe buys own company shares from common stock
	2. vehicle buy
	3. fee for delivery - income 
	4. operating exp
	
say : jan(10k) - dec(40k) ----> profit = 30 k (wrong choice)


financial statements : 

	1. income statements
	2. balance sheet
	3. cash flow
	
income statement :

 	* How profitable a company - particular period
 	* week/month/one year

	recording : 
		1. cash
		2. accural
		
cash : 
	1. when cash leaves / received
	2. simple, intuitive, widely accepted
	3. cash flow view
	4. small companies, littele / no inventory
	
accural : 
	1. when transaction incurred
	2. once per week - payment received (eg)
	
dec(order placed)
paid(jan)
---------------------
accural : recorded for income statement dec
--------------------------------------------

both cash and accural - same over period of time just different times of recording payments

	3. payments expected - earned(dispatched / invoiced)
	4. record - in relational time of expected payment)
	
cash - no full picture, info missing
accural - full flow, info



Revenue : 

	1. delivery fee
	2. revenue recognition principle - record when invoiced

expense : 

	1. record when incurred - matching principle
	2. profit = revenue - expense
	3. say : 20k loan - 1200 per year interest means
per year : 100 interest
	4. each month : 100 - cost necessary to meet ends(cover exp)
	
	
revenue - product, service
expense - revenue cost(product,service), R&D, sales and marketing, administrative




Balance sheet : 

	1. Asset
	2. Liability
	3. share holders equity
	
	note : specific point in time rather than period
	
Assets : 

	1. vehicle, cash, supplies, equipments
	2. Amount receivable
	3. prepaid
	4. cost principle and conservation
	5. depreciation
	
prepaid : 

	jan 1 - bought 1200 insurance for 6 min
	feb 1 - 1 month worth insurance expired
	
	expense : 200 
	asset : 1000 un expired insurance
	
	as expired  asset decreases
	
	
cost principle and conservatism : 

	1. original cost price recorded - even market value increased
	2. actual cost rather than current cost
	3. acountants can show less amount than cost - conservatism
	4. must not show more amount than actual
	
eg : usually don't increase value of an asset 
	 100 boxes each 1 rupee -> 0.60 (reduced)
	 net realizable value low - report lower 
	
	
	
Depreciation : 

	* equipments, vehicles, buildings - value depriciation
	* wear off, old - obsolete(computers)
	* say after 5 years : 0
	* assets - not reported fair market value - at balance sheet
	* long term asset(building) -> cost - amount already sent to income statement(depreciation expense)
	* due to this - even building's value increased - asset value decreased(depriciation expense)	
	
note : land - not depreciated(even 100 times increased still remains same value in asset sheet)


balance sheet reports only the assets acquired and only at the cost reported in the transaction.




liabilities : 

	1. amount owed - loan, interest, wages payable
	2. money received in advance - also liability
	3. dec 1 receipt : 600 but only earned only by delivering
	4. by dec 1 ---> asset cash = 600, liability = 600
	


Share holder's equity  :
	1. sole proprietorship - owner's equity
	2. stockholder's equity = asset - liability
	3. "Book of value"
	
corporate asset - cost price / get reduced - never increased
so state holders equity and corp networth are not same


stockholders equity : 

	1. common stock - shares for money
	2. retained earnings - profit(increase)
	
	
	
Cash flow : 

	1. cash amount changed during interval - cash gen, used - investing, financial activities 
	2. from fin statement and balance sheet
	

Double entry system  : 

	1. modern and old system - based on this
	2. each and every transactions - recorded in atleast 2 system
	
chart of accounts  :
    1. list of all accounts
    2. balance sheet accounts - assets, liabilities, stockholder's equity
    3. income statement accounts - revenue, expense, gain, loss
    
    
Balance Sheet accounts:

Asset accounts (Examples: Cash, Accounts Receivable, Supplies, Equipment)
Liability accounts (Examples: Notes Payable, Accounts Payable, Wages Payable)
Stockholders' Equity accounts (Examples: Common Stock, Retained Earnings)
Income Statement accounts:

Revenue accounts (Examples: Service Revenues, Investment Revenues)
Expense accounts (Examples: Wages Expense, Rent Expense, Depreciation Expense)





eg : starts business with 50000 - shop(say)

asset = cash = 50000

now buys 3 trucks each - 15k


asset : 

	cash - 50k
	3 trucks - 45k
	
liability : 
	loan : 45k
	
equity : 50k(common share)


asset = equity + liability = 45k + 50k



* 1 st transaction affects - both common share and asset cash(investment)



Credit and debit : (neither good / nor bad)

	1. left - debit
	2. right - credit
	
* to increase asset balance - put more on left of asset account
* to balance - increase liability / stockholder equity - put more on right

asset = liability + share holders equity

receive cash -> increase cash account(left - debit)
pays cash -> cash account is credited

* debits and credits are not adding / subtracting
* just words - to reflect duality of fin transactions



credit - source (liability, revenue, owner's equity)
debit - destination (asset, expenses, dividend)


eg : bought 20k worth of shares

              debit  credit
cash	       20k	
common stock           20k


eg : purchase - delivery van 15k - cash, vehicles


			debit	credit
vehicles	14k
cash				 14k


now only 4k remaining in cash asset


asset : 

1. cash - 6k
2. vehicle - 14k

liabilities : 

1. stockholder's equity : 20k



eg : insurance - 1200 - next six months

cash, prepaid insurance, insurance expense

after 1 month : 200 expired, 1000 remaining


						debit    credit
prepaid insurance		1.2k
cash							  1.2k

asset : 

1. cash - 4.8k
2. prepaid insurance - 1.2k
vehicles - 14k

liabilities : 

1. stockholder's equity : 20k





eg : delivery order : 10 - (service revenue, account cash)

account cash - debit 10
service revenue - credit 10



eg : 50 parcels delivered immediatelt - 250(within 7 days) - dec 3

dec 3 itself earned - 250 dollars(invoiced)
note : not yet received

amount yet receivable - 250 (debit)
service revenue - 250 (credit)



eg: expense : temporary help - 80(due by dec 12) - dec 3(now)

liability to pay

temp help expense - debit - 80
amounts payable : credit - 80




note : expense are almost always debited
       but here : no expense right away - company owes someone(liability) - accounts payable (make it as credit then)




net income = 10 + 150 = 160

whole picture : 

1. own stock 20k bought by joe
2. delivery van - 14k
3. insurance for van - 1200k(6months)
4. 10 paid for delivery - delivered
5. 250 - receivable by dec 7
6. help for 80 yet to pay


asset : 

	1. cash = 20k - 14k - 1.2k + 10 (since 250 not received and 80 not paid) = 4810
	2. receivable = 250
	3. vehicle = 14k
	4. prepaid insurance = 1.2k
	
liabilities and equities  :

	1. owner's equity : 20k
	2. payable - 80
	3. retained revenue(after dividend...) - net gain = 250 + 10  - 80 = 180
	
	
	asset = 20180 = liability + stock equity
	
	
each new year : revenue and expense accounts zeroed - start new

indirect method - used mostly


* single statement - not enough

* understand inflow and outflow

* rev, exp, net income on inc statement must be consistent with cash balance



net income = 230k
adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash of op act : 
	
	depreciation / amotization = 63k
	loss on equ sale = 15k
	change in asset / liability
		inc in accounts rec = 21k
		dec in pre exp = 3k
		dec in acc payable = 28k
		
net cash = 230k + 63k + 15k (as won't affect cash but reduced in net income) = 308k
308k - 21k(as already added in net income - not cash received) + 3k(already reduced so + ) + 28k

	= 262k
	
cash flow from investing activities : 

	capital expenditure = 300k (spent from cash reserve)
	sale of equipment : 40k(inflow)
	


eg : 

1. invested : 2000,  inventory : 700

cash = 1300

2. 10 calci sold - march 10 - 800 on feb 28, 500 exp

cash = 1300 (already)
net income = 800 - 500 = 300
300 - 800 + 500 (800 yet to receive, 500 op decrease in inventory - doesn't affect cash)

	= 1300
	
3. received 800 - revenue of feb not march

current month - no rev, no exp

1300 + 800 = 2100(cash)

4. april 28 - 150 supplies due may 30 

net income = 0

2100

5. may - received 150 but it's april's 

this month = 0

2100 + 150 = 2250

bought office equipment = 1100 -> not expense

but paid in cash 

2250 - 1100 = 850

6. june  - 20 per month depreciation

expense = 20

net income = -20

cash = 850 + 20 -20 = 850




note : each period end - stock equity got increased


eg : truck - 20k , accumulated depreciation = 18k
book value = 2k, sold = 3k

net income increased by 1k
if 1500 sold - net income decreased by 500


7. july - sold equipment -> 900 (20 depreciation acc)

book value = 1100 - 20 = 1080

180 loss


net income = -180 (doesn't affect cash) - but affects equity


850 + 900 (received) = 1750 cash

but affects equity

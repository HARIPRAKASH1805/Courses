* purchase on credit - pay later
* accounts receivable - asset
* if don't pay : 	
		* bad debt / credit loss - inc statement
		* reduction of acc receivables
		
* for it purposes - reported at a later date 


4000 - pay later

acc receivable - debit 4k
service revenues - credit 4k

reported in bal sheet, inc stat and change - equity 

1. FOB shipping point - buyer pay to get goods delivered
	* no delivery exp to seller
	* at shipping point buyer is the owner - sold reported to buyer's inventory
	
2. FOB delivery - seller incur delivery expense (delivers at destination)
	* while transit - still seller's inventory until delivered - not sold
	


FOB shipping point : 
	1000 - cost of goods(80% of sales value)
	
acc receivable - 1k (debit)
sales		   - 1k (credit)


cost of goods sold - 800 debit (lead)
inventory          - 800 credit (girls)


FOB destination : 

	sales value : 1050, cost of good - 800
	
	
acc receivable - 1050 debit
sales          - 1050 credit


cost of goods - 800 debit
inventory     - 800 credit



seller - assumes risks of transporting

so indeed it has operating expense say(50 to deliver)




credit terms with discount : 

	say 1000 worth sold - 100 returned
	net purchase = 900
	
net 30 - but paid in 45 days - speed up discounts
2/10 - 2% discount - net 10
now 900 - 0.02 * 900 = 882 


june 1 - acc receivable - 1k debit
		 services       - 1k credit
		 
june 1 - cost of goods sold - 800 debit
		 inventory          - 800 credit
		 
june 6 - sales returns, allowance - 100 debit
		 accounts receivable - 100 credit
		 
june 6 - inventory - 80 debit
		 cost of goods - 80 credit
		 
june 11 - cash 882 debit
		  sales disc 18 debit
		  acc receibale - 900 credit
		  
say july 1 paid : cash 900 debit
				  acc receivable - 900 credit
				  


credit risk : 
	* no hold of buyer's assets - seller(insecured)
	* cash / credit card
	
allowance methods for reporing credit losses : 

	* current receivable - current asset
	* current asset - expected with in 1 year - chance of overstating acc receivable(not collectible)
	* estimate - doubtful accounts - contra asset account
	* any increase in doubtful account also recorded in income statement's bad debts expense(uncollectible acc exp)
	* this is allowance method
	
june 30 - 100k appr 2000 - can't be recovered

june 30 -bad exp 2k debit
		 allowance for doubtful acc(contra ..) - 2k
		 
net realizable value = 100k - 2k = 98k


* just an assumption : doesn't need to know which customer won't pay nor exact amount
* accepted by accountants - better than assuming every penny collectable

above : we can't say which one pays how much what's why allowance method is for (above - we assumed for 100k, 2k is at stake)


Allowance method : 
	1. specific account - uncollectable - reduce receivable
	2. reflects only balance sheet - not income stats - since written off as covered
	
	
eg : 1400 (bankrupt), we decided 10k allowance for doubt..

aug 24 allowance for doubtful acc - 1400 debit(credit account so 8600 remaining)
	   acc receivable             - 1400 credit
	   
	   
now : 

accounts receivable : 

june 1 bal = 0
june sales = 100k debit

july sales = 225k debit
			 95k credit(received)
			 
bal : 230k

aug sales : 204k debit
		    194k credit - received
		    
aug 24 : 1.4k (not receivable - confirmed)

bal : 238600
	
	
Doubtful accounts

june 30 - 2k (dountful) credit
july 31 - 8k (doubtful) ---> total 10k credit
aug 24  - 1.4k confirmed - debit - can't return


say customer paid(will pay) written off amount : 

adjustment : 

oct 10 - acc rec -1.4k debit
		 allowance for doubtful acc - 1.4k(restore allowance)
		 

say paid amount : 

oct 10 cash 1.4k debit
	   acc rec - 1.4k credit
	   
	   


Bad debts expense as a percent of sales : 

	say 0.3 % of each week's credit sales 
	
500k means - 1.5k won't return


bad debt exp - 1.5k debit
allowance for doubtful acc - 1.5k credit(restore as won't return)







Expense vs Allowance : 

	bad debts : credit losses - during income statement
(temp account) 
	Allowance for doubtful acc - balance sheet acc - uncollectible (not included in acc receivable)
	
	expense acc - closed each year
	
but allowance - not closed so there will be a mismatch

say : end of year - 14k both bad debt exp and doubtful acc


second year : 14k allowance, 0 - bad debt exp
3k adjust

now : 3k bad debt exp, 17k doubtful acc


mailing statements - thankyou for continued business - reminding is the goal but not looks like one




note : use of allowance method - not permitted in us income tax -IRS 


direct wireoff method : 

say june 5 - 1238 - known definitely uncollectable 

oct 21 bad debt exp - 1238 debit
	   acc receivable - 1238 credit

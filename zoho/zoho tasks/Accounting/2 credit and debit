T - account : 


--------------------------------------------------------

		debit				|     credit
(inc - received)			|  (decrease - paid)
decrease - repaid loan		|  increase - liability - borrowed 
							|
							
							
							
borrow 5000 : (cash account - debit, payable - credit)

cash account : 

--------------------------------------------------------

		debit				|     credit
(inc - received)			|  (decrease - paid)
june1, 2022     5000		|  
							|							
							
Payable : 

credit : 5000 june 1


2. repay - 2000 to bank loan

cash : june 2, balance - 3000 - debit
	   june 2, 2000 - credit (bank loan)
	   
notes payable : debit - june 2   2000


Journal entries : 

	1. another way to visualize business transactions
	
eg : 

june 1,2021   cash  - debit(5000) 
			  notes payable - credit(5000)
			  
june 2 2021 cash - credit(2000)
			payable notes - debit (2000)
			
			
memorize - cash received - debit
		   cash paid - credit
		   
journal entry : 
	1. like log - account credited, account debited, date
	
	
say : merchandise received - may 1
      paid - may 31 
      
journal entry for may 1

may 1 2021  payable - credit(300)
	        purchase - debit(300)
      
journal entry for may 31 

may 31 2021 	cash - credit(300)
			    payable - debit(300)
							
							

usually : 

debit - asset, contra liability, dividend account, owner's drawing, expense, lossess(deal)							
credit - girls - gain, income/revenue, contra asset, owner's equity, liability ,stock holder's equity


contra account : 

	* An offset that reduces the value of related account
	* say reduced an asset value due to depreciation - record history(know how its value price surged)
	* balance sheet - original(historical cost price / depreciated)
	* in contra account - depreciation value sub from particular account to give net book value
	* low net book value = need to replace(tools, furniture...)
	* returns and allowances - offsets sales (another contra acc
	
usually, in general ledger - sales account - credit
returns and allowance - debit
(know what % returned)


other doubtful account - another conta account

credit balance offset debit balance on receivables of balance sheet

(amount - uncollectable receivables company expects)


1. revenues and gains are usually vredited
2. expense and losses are usually debited


permanent accounts : asset, liability, owner/stock holder equity  - won't be closed at the end of year(balance sheet account)

temporary accounts : revenue, expense, owner's drawing, income summary acocunts - closed (income statement account)

note : balance transferred to owner's capital account / retained earnings account




Bank's point of view - consistent to credit and debit


eg : 100 for future site clean-up

cash - debit (100)
unearned revenues - credit(100)

bank : say 100 deposit (bank - liability (not earned))

cash - debit (100)
customer account - 100 credit


say - bank charge 13 per month

customer checking account - debit(13)
revenue account of bank - credit(13)


bank : cash, investment securities, loans receivable -> assets
	   cust accounts, balances in customers - liabilities
	   
our account - one of millions account - bank owes to its depositors


deep dive : 

	1. credit - cr
	2. debit - dr
	
asset = liability + sole / stockholder's equity


even though - we don't record revenues, expenses, gain/loss directly into an equity account - still equity increases / decreases



asset accounts normally debit balances - increased with debit entry
liability accounts for credit entry - increased with credit entry


capital account / stock holders account - have credit balances - credit entry (retained earnings)

ratio : compare two values - analysis
https://www.accountingcoach.com/financial-ratios/explanation/2

1. Working capital
	current asset - current liability

2. current ratio
	current assets / current liabilities
(a manufacturer need more assets while a simple supplier don't need inventory operate sommothly with 1 ratio)

3. quick(acid test ratio)
	eliminate inventory and prepaid exp from asset in current rati
	
	quick ratio = (cash + cash eq + temp inv + accounts recie) / current liabilities (manufactuer has acid ratio lower than current ratio since they manage inventory)

4. debt to equity ratio
	total liabilities / total stock holder's equity

5. debt to total assets
	total liability / total asset

6. gross margin( gross profit %)
	net sales = gross sales - sales discounts - sales return - sales allowances
	
	gross margin = gross profit / net sales
	(gross profit = net sales - cost of prod / serv)
	
	multiply by 100 to get %

7. profit margin(%)
	Profit margin before tax = net income before tax / net sales

Profit margin after tax = net income after tax / net sales

	mul by 100 to get %
	
8. earnings per share

	= net income after tax / no of shares of common stock outstanding

9. times interest erned(interest coverage ratio)

	= Times interest earned = net income before interest and income tax expense / interest expense
	
	net income before tax = 560k
	interest exp = 30k
	it exp = 160k
	
	560 + 30 + 160 / 30 = 25 times

10. receivables turnover ratio
		Net credit sales = gross credit sales (cash sales are excluded) minus any related sales discounts, sales returns, and sales allowances.
		
		Receivables turnover ratio = net credit sales for the year / average amount in accounts receivable
		
note : income statement - don't have net credit sales
       it has net sales(credit + cash sales)
       
       credit sale = paying later

outsiders don't have daily, monthly data - calc average amount in receivable - they simply take two then do math
	

11. day's sales in receivables

	Days' sales in receivables = 365 days / receivables turnover ratio

(inventory -> receivable)

12. inventory turnover ratio

	* speed at which inventory itesms are sold(past)
	
	Inventory turnover ratio = cost of goods sold for the year / average cost of inventory during the year

13. day's sales in inventory(days to sell) - avg no of days to sell its inventory

	Days' sales in inventory = 365 days / inventory turnover ratio

14. return on stockholder's equity

	net income after tax / avg amount of stockholder's equity

15. free cash flow

	Free cash flow = net cash provided by operating activities â€“ capital expenditures
	
	note  :If a corporation considers its cash dividends paid to stockholders to be a requirement, the corporation could also subtract the required dividend amount. 
	
	


first 5 - balance sheet
next 4 - income statement
10 - 14 (both balance and income statement)


collecting, selling - how much speed(10-14)

high receivables turnover ratio and high inventory turnover ratio - goodddd








Expressing every income statement amount as a percent of net sales, and every balance sheet amount as a percent of total assets is referred to as vertical analysis.


Horizontal analysis shows a financial statement amount over a minimum of two years.

	* comparitive, time series analysis

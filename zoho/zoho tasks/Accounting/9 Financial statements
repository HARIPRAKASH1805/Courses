net income = 19kk
add back : depriciation exp = 9k

cash flow from operating activities = 28k


receivable increased by 300 means : 

28k - 300 = 27700

(receivables, service revenue tackles) that's why only taking increased amount alone

payable increased by 250

(payable, service expense got tackled) that's why taking increased amount alone

27700 + 250 = 27950

note : receive - debit, pay - credit
note : net income = net income(cash + receivables + ...) - net expense

so cash flow = cash currently have(minus receivales + payables)


1. depriciation : not actually money got reduced but in net income we reduce it
cash remains same so we add depreciation

2. receivable : added as receivable but cash not received
so subtracted from net income

3. payable - reduced from net income but not yet paid cash remains same - so add net income




1. operating activity : 

	net cash = 100k
	depriciation = 30k(exp didn't use cash)
	decrease in accounts payable = 9k
	decrease in accounts receivale = 5k
	
receivable decreased - but net income already considered took sum - even decreased -> took minus(cash remains same)

	net cash = 100 + 30 + 5(sub to get net income -> but cash remains same, so add)
	
	decrease in payable - added 9k to get net income(as liability decreased asset increased) - no cash incolved so sub 9k
	
	100 + 30 + 5 - 9 = 126k
	
	
2. investing activities : 

	* bought(outflow), sold(inflow)
	* capital expenditure = (95k) -> bracket means negative
	* proceeds from sale of property = 15k
	* sale of investments = 30k
	--------------------------------------------
	-95k(outflow) + 15k + 30k = (50k) -> negative
	--------------------------------------------
	
	
3. Financing activities : 

	* borrowed / issued money
	* dividends - (10k)
	* repayment of short term debt - (20k)
	* long term borrowing - 60k (inflow)
	* purchase of treasury stock  (2k)
	------------------------------------------
	-10k -20k + 60k - 2k = 28k
	------------------------------------------
	

free cash flow : amount of cash from op activities required for  capital expenditures. (some people also include dividends -> cash from op - cap exp - div)

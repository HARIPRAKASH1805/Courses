	2. one cash account for main checking account
	3. second cash account for payroll checking account
	
	
eg :

	1. asset - cash, investment securities, loans rec
	2. liability : customer deposits
	3. customer deposits  : checking accounts, savings, certificate of deposit
	4. customer accounts (liabilites)
	
900 deposit - asset = +900 (debit)
			  liability (credit)
			  

eg :

	liab  - 10k credit
	
    2. pay rent 1k - aug 1 check - 3d later - cash
    1k debit in liability
    1k credit in cash account

adjustments : 

outstanding checks : written, recorded in cash acc, not cleared (paid) - outstanding (true bal = sub this amount)

deposit in transit : checks received, general ledger - entered, but not processed to record cash - outstanding deposits

bank errors : bank erros - find and corrected


bank credit memos :

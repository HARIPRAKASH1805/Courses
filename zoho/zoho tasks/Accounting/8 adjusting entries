why adjusting ? 

* borrow - dec 1 2021 - accounting period ends 31 dec 2021
  first interest due : march 1
  
* when to report ? - report liability(borrowed) + liability interest ( include december's interest in dec report)

* say amount as advance (dec 1 to may 31 - 2400)

by dec 31 - one month used up(400 used up -expense)
2000 - asset - prepaid insurance

dec 1 - prepaid insurance - 2400
dec 31 - prepaid insurance - 2000

so adjusting needed



Adjusting entries almost always involve a

* balance sheet account (Interest Payable, Prepaid Insurance, Accounts Receivable, etc.) and an
* income statement account (Interest Expense, Insurance Expense, Service Revenues, etc.)



adjusting assure - up to date accural basis accounting

* we need to record earned - not only billed - adjusting needed


3000 - receivable (adjust)


				Accounts receivable(balance sheet)
---------------------------------------------------------------
debit                       |  credit
							|
preliminary balance 4.6k    |
adjusting entry 3k          |
correct balance 7.6k        |


			Service revenue (income statement)
-----------------------------------------------------------
debit                       |  credit
							|  60234 preliminary bal
							|  adjusting entry 3k
							|  63234 - correct bal
							|

ledger : 

dec 31 2021 accounts receivable debit 3k
			service revenue credit 3k
			
allowance for doubtful accounts : 
	* doesn't appear on preliminary bal sheet
	* dishonesty, unforeseen hardships
	
without reducing receivable by means of credit amount - do in allowance for doubtful accounts


1. say : 600 won't be collected

doubtful accounts : credit 600
bad debts expense : 600 debit

note : doubtful accounts - balance account
       bad debt expense - income statement(fresh year)
       

2. supplies - 1100, but found on hand - 725 ( too high 375)

supplies - (credit) - 375 --> now : 725
supplies expense - (debit) - 375 ---> now : 1975


3. insurance - > 1 month expired

prepaid insurance - credit - 900
insurance expiry - debit 900

4. accumulated depreciation = 7500 

equipment depreciation - credit 7500
depreciation expense equipment = debit 7.5k

5. 5000 dec 1 borrowed - first interest 6% - 300 per year / 25 per month

(march 1 - 75 interest)

dec 31 - interest 25 must be reported


interest payable - 25 credit
interest expense - 25 debit


6. 1000 pulmbing repairs done in late dec, not received invoice

accounts payable - 1000 credit
repairs and maintenance expense - 1000 debit

7. wages payable, wages expense



accural : 

	1. nothing entered in records - but exp/revenue - occured and must includes in current perioff's income statement and balance sheet
	2. adjusting entry needed(earned but not received)
	
deferral : 
	* 1 month used up -> defer remaining into prepaid account
	* advance but not earned  or paid but not used up
	
(liability - advance payment)


avoid adjusting : ask bank for monthly interest pay monthly, monthly insurance

<p>Hi Everyone!</p><p>In the next challenge, Colt will introduce a question that requires use of a concept he has yet to teach.</p><p>I highly recommend that you try to solve the challenge on your own, but if you can't get the answer after 15-30 minutes then don't spend too much more time on it. He will be explaining the new concept in the solution.<br><br>-------<br>Thanks,<br>Ian</p>

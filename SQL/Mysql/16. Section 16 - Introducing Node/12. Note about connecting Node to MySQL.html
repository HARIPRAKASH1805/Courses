<p>Hi Everyone!</p><p>We <strong>do not recommend</strong> using AWS for this course, but if you are using the AWS version of Cloud9 then you'll need to skip to <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-ultimate-mysql-bootcamp-go-from-sql-beginner-to-expert/learn/v4/t/lecture/7031756/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this lecture</a> to see how to add a password to the MySQL connection code. </p><p>Once you've reviewed the extra steps then you can circle back and watch the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-ultimate-mysql-bootcamp-go-from-sql-beginner-to-expert/learn/v4/t/lecture/6996806/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Connecting Node to MySQL</a> lecture, just be sure to add in the root password as described in the link/lecture above.</p><p>If you're using the <a href="https://wdb-c9-invite.herokuapp.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">original c9</a> that Colt uses in the videos then you won't have to worry about these extra steps.</p><p>-------<br>Thanks,<br>Ian<br></p>

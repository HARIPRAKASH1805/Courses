<p>Hi All!</p>

<p>In the next lecture you'll learn about a tool called Faker that allows you to create fake placeholder data to use in your applications. When you install Faker in your project you might encounter some warnings that Colt doesn't get in the video.</p>

<p>Please don't be alarmed, these warnings are simply telling you that your project doesn't have a package.json file. You can safely ignore them as it is non-consequential at this point in the exercise.&nbsp;</p><p>However, if you'd like to prevent the warning messages from occurring then you can simply create your app.js file in the project folder then run the command <code>npm init -y</code>&nbsp;which will create a corresponding package.json file.</p><p>-------<br>Thanks,<br>Ian</p>

Congrats, you found the murderer! But wait, there's more... If you think you're up for a challenge, try querying the interview transcript of the murderer to find the real villain behind this crime. If you feel especially confident in your SQL skills, try to complete this final step with no more than 2 queries. Use this same INSERT statement with your new suspect to check your answer.


SELECT * FROM interview WHERE person_id = 67318;

I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. I don't know her name but I know she's around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67"). She has red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S. I know that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017.

SELECT *
    FROM drivers_license
    WHERE gender = 'female' AND hair_color = 'red' -- She has red hair
      AND car_make = 'Tesla' AND car_model = 'Model S' -- and she drives a Tesla Model S
      AND height >= 64 AND height <= 68;
	  
SELECT *, COUNT(*) AS num

WHERE event_name LIKE 'SQL Symphony Concert' AND date LIKE '201712%'
GROUP BY person_id
HAVING Num = 3

Congrats, you found the brains behind the murder! Everyone in SQL City hails you as the greatest SQL detective of all time. Time to break out the champagne!

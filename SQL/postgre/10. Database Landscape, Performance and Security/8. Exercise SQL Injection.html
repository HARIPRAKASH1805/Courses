<p>Let's learn about one of the most common ways attackers can affect a Database: SQL&nbsp;Injections!<br><br>First, let's learn how it works by actually performing it on a database. Go to this link to try the interactive exercise: <a href="https://www.hacksplaining.com/exercises/sql-injection" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.hacksplaining.com/exercises/sql-injection</a><br><br>Once done, you can learn about how to prevent this sort of attack here: <a href="https://www.hacksplaining.com/prevention/sql-injection" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.hacksplaining.com/prevention/sql-injection</a><br><br>I have also included optional videos (next 2 videos) from my other course <strong>Junior to Senior Web Developer Roadmap</strong> where we discuss best security practices for web developers. This way you get to learn how Injection attacks are prevented even before it gets to the database :)</p>

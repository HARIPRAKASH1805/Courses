<p>In the next part of this setup you will be asked to run the <code>psql</code> command. This is a tool that is shipped with Postgres that allows you to communicate with Postgres through commandline. In order to setup commandline properly to know the&nbsp; <code>psql</code> command you must setup the PATH environment properly!</p><p>The best way to setup your commandline to work with postgres in commandline is to follow the steps mentioned on Postgres App's documentation portal:</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://postgresapp.com/documentation/cli-tools.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://postgresapp.com/documentation/cli-tools.html</a></p><p><br></p><p>This documentation talks about adding postgres to your <code>PATH</code> variable, now this sounds like a strange foreign language, believe me I know! In essence if you think of commandline like a piece of software that strictly talks by text interface, then the commands themselves are "instructions" now the commandline needs to know what instructions it can have available. </p><p><br></p><p>By default MAC&nbsp;ships with common "instructions" like "<code>cd</code>" (change directory), "<code>ls</code>"&nbsp;(list files), etc. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Postgres installed with a bunch of "instructions" now we just need to tell your MAC&nbsp;commandline where to find them. That's what the </strong><code><strong>PATH</strong></code><strong>&nbsp;variable is for! It tells your MAC&nbsp;where to find instructions for other software.</strong></p>

<p>One of the hardest parts of the course is coming up! When it comes to installing different software on your computer, things become complex because there are so many types of computers/configurations and other factors that each of you have. We have tried to make things as simple as possible, but if you encounter any issues with the setup, please reach out to us in the <strong>#databases </strong>channel on Discord so we can help you out :)<br><br>Just remember to not get discouraged. Usually it is common to struggle during the setup and installation phases but once we get it right, it's smooth sailing from there!</p>
